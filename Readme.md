This example shows how to create a controller that allows you to save the state of the current view as a view variant and apply saved variants to a view.

Please note that this can be a complex task that requires good knowledge of XAF: [UI Customization Categories by Skill Level](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/application_framework/xaf-considerations-for-newcomers.xml#ui-customization-categories). You will likely need to research how our components work under the hood.

## Implementation Details

To accomplish this task, we created a dedicated [controller](CS/EF/ViewVariantSaveEF/ViewVariantSaveEF.Module/Controllers/UserViewVariantsController.cs) that stores the state of a current view as a new view variant in an application model. The same controller allows users to apply existing view variants to a view.
